<!--
Files needed:
• CreateUser.html
• CreateUser.php
Using HTML forms again, create a simple frontend that allows the user to create a new user to store in the database. A simple text field and submit button will do. When the user submits, the backend should tell the user if the new user was successfully stored in the database.
The new user should not be stored if:
• The user left the text field empty
• The user already exists
Note: The msqli.query($query) method returns, essentially, false if it does not work.
(Again, use “mysql.eecs.ku.edu” in place of “database_URL” when you’re connecting to your database.)
